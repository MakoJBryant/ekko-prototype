# 🌌 Project Ekko

**Project Ekko** is a minimalist third-person survival RPG set on a decaying, fully-explorable planet. Blending elements of *Outer Wilds*, *Fable*, and *Rain World*, it features permadeath, artifact-based combat, tangible world interaction, and a dynamic ecosystem that remembers everything you do.

> "Your world is the save file."

## 🎮 Core Features

* 🪐 **Tiny Planet Open World** — Explore a small, spherical world with simulated gravity and orbital physics.
* 🔄 **Persistent Worldstate** — The world evolves with or without you; characters, settlements, and ecosystems live or die based on player actions.
* ☠️ **Permadeath & Legacy** — When you die, your influence remains. Return as a new character, but your consequences stay.
* 🧿 **Cursed Relic Combat** — Weapons are unstable ancient relics with powerful but unpredictable effects.
* 🚛 **Physical Inventory System** — No UI menus; carry, load, and store items by hand or vehicle.
* 🏚️ **Settlement Evolution** — Settlements grow or collapse based on trade, diplomacy, and leadership—without direct control.
* 🎭 **Faction Identity Through Culture** — Music, attire, structure, and behavior express each group's identity, not just dialogue.

- **Rain World** – Harsh ecosystems and movement-driven gameplay  
- **Majora’s Mask** – A haunting, clockwork world with scheduled NPCs, eerie beauty, and personal side stories woven into a looping structure  
- **Sable / Death Stranding** – Slow travel and tactile exploration

## 🗺️ Vision

> A grounded, mysterious world that reacts to your presence. You are not the hero—just one part of a decaying system struggling to survive.

---

## 📌 Status

> Early prototyping (gravity system, world state persistence, and speeder physics). All systems are modular and designed to be layered gradually.
