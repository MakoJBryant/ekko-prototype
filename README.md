# 🌌 Project Ekko

**Project Ekko** is a minimalist third-person survival RPG set on a decaying, fully-explorable planet. Blending elements of *Outer Wilds*, *Rain World*, and *Shadow of the Colossus*, it features permadeath, slow tactical combat, physical interaction, and a dynamic ecosystem that remembers everything you do.

> "Your world is the save file."

## 🎮 Core Features

- 🪐 **Tiny Planet Open World** — Explore a small, spherical world with simulated gravity and orbital physics.  
- 🔄 **Persistent Worldstate** — The world evolves with or without you; characters, settlements, and ecosystems live or die based on player actions.  
- ☠️ **Permadeath & Legacy** — When you die, your influence remains. Return as a new character, but your consequences stay.  
- 🔫 **Tactical Survival Combat** — Inspired by mil-sim games like *Far Cry 2* and *The Long Dark*, with slow gunplay, magazine-based reloading, and jamming weapons.  
- 🚛 **Physical Inventory System** — No UI menus; carry, load, and store items by hand or vehicle.  
- 🏚️ **Settlement Evolution** — Settlements grow or collapse based on trade, diplomacy, and leadership—without direct control.  
- 🎭 **Faction Identity Through Culture** — Music, attire, structure, and behavior express each group's identity, not just dialogue.

## 🗺️ Vision

> A grounded, mysterious world that reacts to your presence. You are not the hero—just one part of a decaying system struggling to survive.

---

## 📌 Status

> Early prototyping (gravity system, world state persistence, and speeder physics). All systems are modular and designed to be layered gradually.
