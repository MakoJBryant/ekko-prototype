# 🌌 Project Ekko

**Project Ekko** is a minimalist third-person survival RPG set on a decaying, fully-explorable planet. Blending elements of *Outer Wilds*, *Rain World*, and *Shadow of the Colossus*, it features permadeath, slow tactical combat, physically grounded interaction, and a dynamic ecosystem that remembers everything you do.

> "Your world is the save file."

## 🎮 Core Features

- 🪐 **Tiny Planet Open World** — Explore a small, spherical world with simulated gravity and orbital physics.  
- 🔄 **Persistent Worldstate & Settlement Evolution** — The world changes based on your actions. Settlements visibly grow, adapt, or collapse over time through your trade, diplomacy, and influence — much like Terry Town in *Tears of the Kingdom* or the Sims Settlements mod for *Fallout 4*.  
- ☠️ **Permadeath & Legacy** — Your character may die, but your impact remains. Return as a new character to a world transformed by your past.  
- 🔫 **Tactical Survival Combat** — Slow-paced, tactical gunplay inspired by *Far Cry 2* and *The Long Dark*, featuring realistic weapon mechanics including jams and magazine reloads.  
- 🚛 **Physical Inventory & Interaction System** — No traditional UI menus. All inventory and trade is handled through physically picking up, carrying, stacking, and loading objects — similar to *Breath of the Wild*’s tactile world interactions.  
- 🎭 **Faction Identity Through Culture & Environment** — Each faction’s personality shines through their music, architecture, attire, and behaviors — not just dialogue.  
- 🌱 **Emergent Ecosystem & NPC Behavior** — Wildlife, enemies, and NPCs live reactive lives, responding dynamically to player actions and settlement evolution.
